# About Me

### Hello!

My name is Rouvin. I like breaking stuff, and am really into cybersecurity.

The point of this book is to introduce people from all walks of life to cybersecurity. Whether you're about to start your security journey or are just passing by this page, I hope that you are able to learn something new from here. Security is something that everyone can gain from.&#x20;

There's loads of free stuff on the Internet in general, and security is definitely part of that. I'd like to thank all the authors and experts that share knowledge online for everyone to learn from!

If you're looking into starting your security journey, take note that this book is not a rulebook. There's no right path to break into cybersecurity, and this book **definitely should not serve as a guideline**. **The right path is the path that works for you.**&#x20;

### Bio
