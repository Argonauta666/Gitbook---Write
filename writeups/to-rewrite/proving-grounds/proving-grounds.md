This part of the notebook is to document every single PG machine I have rooted when I eventually begin the course.

PG, or Proving Grounds, is just another platform that was created to help emulate the exam and prepare us. Rumour says that the boxes here and very similar to that of OSCP.

&#x20;

The OSCP is an entry-level penetration testing certification that basically establishes you have the base knowledge to be a pentester. This is one of the hardest practical exams within the industry, due to the steep learning curve.

As of 28/7/2022, I have finished all boxes for PG Practice. All 100 have been rooted. I will be cancelling my subscription.
