These are the boxes with writeups I have written. Take a look at these for more information and in-depth analysis of my thought process and stuff. It might have taken a bit of time and effort, but I think it is worth it.

&#x20;

**For the first 5 entries of this section, take note that I did not place much focus on the writeups, only from 'Sense' onwards were the writeup better.**

&#x20;

All of the boxes that I will be doing will be based on TJNull's OSCP HTB List for this section.

The boxes that are in the red column are the ones that are generally harder than OSCP, while the green ones are mainly the machines that are more relevant to the current OSCP version CAA 2021.

&#x20;

**Additionally, the AD machines are found in the Active Directory section, and they're all Windows machines.**
