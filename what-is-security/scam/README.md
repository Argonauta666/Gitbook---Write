# Scam?

Sometimes, when I get a scam email sent to me with a funny looking link, I open them up in a VM to fuzz it and check what's up. Sometimes, I can't verify if this is a scam or not, but at the very least I am careful!

Nowadays, I'm quite hopeful I get a phishing email so I can write these. Always fun to see scams like this. They are painfully obvious.&#x20;
