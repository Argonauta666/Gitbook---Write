# SMB

Server Message Block (SMB) is a communucation protocol used for file sharing purposes across nodes on a network of systems. This is the basis for Microsoft's Distributed File System implementation, and relies on TCP and IP protocols for transport.

Generally, these run on port 139 and 445 when scanning machines.

## Authentication

SMB relies on NTLM hashes for authentication. The mechanisms looks like this:

The authentication request is first sent, and then the server responds with a challenge. The challenge would sent the encrypted password hash of the user back to the user who requested this (which is obviously insecure). &#x20;
