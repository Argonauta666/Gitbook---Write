# Introduction

Computer networks are basically interconnected devices that can exchange information and send data to one another using a set of communication protocols. The transferring of information can be done either physically through wire, or wirelessly.&#x20;

Networking is an indispensable asset for security, and InfoSec people must understand this pretty well. Plus, it's quite interesting and fun as well. Learning how things like the OSI model and routers work is essential for exploitation.&#x20;

The knowledge here is based off on the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam, which I found really enjoyable to learn from. Not all the topics would be covered, like Hot Standy Router Protocol (HSRP), but rather the core fundamentals.

I've heard the stuff covered in CCNA is similar to CS2105, Introduction to Computer Networks minus all the proprietary technlogies.&#x20;

If you want to go for the CCNA course or learn more, I **highly recommend Neil Anderson's Udemy CCNA Course.** He explains the topics really well, and it comes with some hands-on labs to test your concepts!
