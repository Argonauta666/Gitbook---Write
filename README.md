# Security

This is just a little compilation of notes and knowledge I gained from scouring the Internet, practicing, going for courses, interning and learning from school. This book primarily serves as my journal for my security related excursions, and also a resource for people that want to learn more about security should they chance upon it

**This will be updated as frequently as I can while juggling school work.**

## Disclaimer

I do not claim to be the most correct, the best, or even remotely good at security or pentesting. I'm just a guy that is into security and wants to learn as much as possible

I do not condone any illegal activity done using any methods in this notebook. All of the concepts listed here are for **educational purposes** only. What you decide to do with these skills is on you.&#x20;

Please exercise responsibility and keep the law in mind when you are learning and testing on systems. Only test your skills on personal systems, or on systems where you have the permission to do so.
